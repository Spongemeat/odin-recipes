    <h1>Stir Fried Celery</h1>

    <p>It can be hard for Vegans and Vegetarians to enjoy Japanese food due to the reliance on fish stock in almost every dish.
        This is a recipe that doesn't use any fish stock to create an addictive plate of stir fried celery.
        Combined with white rice, this quick and simple dish won't last long on the table</p>
