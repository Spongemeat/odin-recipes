    <h1> Vegan Miso Soup </h1>

    <p>It can be hard for Vegans and Vegetarians to enjoy Japanese food due to the reliance on fish stock in almost every dish.
    This is a recipe that doesn't use any fish stock to create a delicious bowl of miso soup that anyone can enjoy
    The use of a darker miso paste as well as onion and shiitake stock more than makes up for the lack of dashi</p>
